├── When depositing into strategy
│   ├── It should accept assets only from Vault.
│   ├── It should forward them to the external protocol (Vesu pool).
│   ├── It should increase its internal asset count or external balance.
│   └── It should return the amount invested or shares gained.
├── When withdrawing from strategy
│   ├── It should only allow Vault to call.
│   ├── If assets available, it should withdraw requested amount.
│   ├── It should transfer assets back to Vault.
│   └── It should report if full amount not retrieved (e.g., slippage).
├── When reporting totalAssets
│   ├── It should reflect current underlying in pool (principal + yield).
│   └── It should equal Vault.totalAssets minus any idle in vault.
├── When harvest is called
│   ├── If profit since last, it should calculate profit > 0.
│   ├── If loss since last, it should report loss > 0.
│   ├── It should not transfer assets in v0 (just reporting).
│   └── It should update lastReported to current.
├── When withdrawAll is called
│   ├── It should redeem all assets from the protocol.
│   ├── It should transfer all to Vault.
│   └── It should result in strategy.totalAssets() = 0.
└── When emergencyWithdraw is called
    ├── It should attempt to withdraw all, ignoring normal limits.
    ├── If successful, strategy holds 0 and Vault receives assets.
    └── If partial, it should still return what was recovered (no revert).
