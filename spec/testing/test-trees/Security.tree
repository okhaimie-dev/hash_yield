├── When deposit amount is extremely small
│   ├── If it would yield 0 shares, it should revert to prevent donation.
│   └── The vault should not accept donations inadvertently.
├── When attacker attempts inflation attack
│   ├── Given attacker deposits minimal and donates large amount to vault
│   └── Victim deposit after should still receive >0 shares (offset active) and attacker gains nothing.
├── When non-admin calls admin functions
│   ├── Calling setStrategy by stranger should revert (Unauthorized).
│   ├── Calling pause or unpause by stranger should revert.
│   └── Calling emergencyWithdraw by stranger should revert.
├── When admin misconfigures
│   ├── Setting strategy with mismatched asset should revert.
│   └── Setting null strategy outside emergency context (if not allowed) should revert or be handled.
├── When ERC20 functions are used
│   ├── transfer of vault shares between users should update balances.
│   ├── allowance on vault shares should allow third-party redeem.
│   └── totalSupply always equals sum of balances (no phantom shares).
└── Invariant checks throughout operations
    ├── After any deposit or withdrawal, totalAssets equals vault+strategy balance.
    ├── Share price never decreases unless a loss event occurs.
    ├── No user's balance goes negative or above totalSupply.
    └── Rounding error at most 1 wei per operation (accumulated dust ≤ #operations).
